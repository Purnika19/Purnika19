# Hi, I'm Purnika Malhotra

### ✨ About Me
I'm a Computer Science student from India with a strong interest in **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Science, and Large Language Models (LLMs)**.  
I enjoy building **intelligent, data-driven systems**, working with **classical ML, deep learning models, computer vision**, and exploring **LLM-powered applications such as RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**.

My focus is on **hands-on learning**, experimenting with data, and developing practical AI solutions that can scale to real-world use cases.
